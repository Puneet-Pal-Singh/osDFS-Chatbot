## Gidhra
Gidhra is a web based chatbot which will serve the query related to osDFS. We are starting this project because we think chatbot can be super helpful to serve query related to osDFS, however the current state of affairs has most chatbots limited to existing messaging platforms such as Facebook, which is quite OK, **but what if we want our bot to live elsewhere on the web?**

We will build our own bot and will define our visual styles and rules as well as will have unlimited control for customization and logic. Various solutions already exist but they can be limiting, costly and hard to implement.
